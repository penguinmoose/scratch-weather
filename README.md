# Scratch weather project

**[https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/830536684/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/830536684/)** (you'll need a scratch account with Scratcher status).

_WEATHER PROJECT 2._ It's finally here. (there was a weather 1, but it wasn't the best, so here's version 2)

To change to Â°C press the unit button on bottom right

Type in any location to get an extremely detailed weather report of the current weather at that location.

**To run/make your own version:**
1. Remix the [scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/830536684/).
2. Install rev2/requirements.txt.
3. Navigate to directory rev2, then
4. Create a `secret.txt` file on the same level as `weather.py`. This secret.txt file must have your scratch username on the first line and the password for that account on the second line.
5. Change the project ID to the correct project ID that matches your remix.
6. Run `python3 weather.py`.
7. IF you want to run with auto-fix program, run instead `./weather.sh`.
