# Scratch weather project

It's now in version 2. Check it out at [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/830536684/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/830536684/) (you'll need a scratch account).

**To run:**
1. Remix the scratch project.
2. Install rev2/requirements.txt.
3. Run rev2/weather.py with a secret.txt file on the same level as weather.py. The secret.txt file should have your Scratch username on the first line and the password for that account on the second. Make sure you also change the project ID to match.
